## Active Stage

### Stage 1 — Household people, profiles, and permissions

- Stage record:
  [`stages/01-household-people/README.md`](stages/01-household-people/README.md)
- Status: Active
- Immediate delivery target:
  [`02-account-linking-invitations-and-departure.md`](stages/01-household-people/02-account-linking-invitations-and-departure.md)
  (`Ready`)

Work Item 01 is complete. [PR #198](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/198)
merged its accepted person-registry implementation as
`9666a8bdae97bd9d6bf4efd98e30d03d617ccb31` on 2026-09-01 after its recorded
runtime, hosted-CI, and exact-head review gates. The merged stable person,
creator link, audit, receipt, API/UI, and isolation evidence is now the base for
Work Item 02.

The Work Item 01 identity boundary derives a stable household-scoped linkage
subject from immutable Better Auth user plus organization identity, separately
from its audit actor. Better Auth's actual `owner` membership role is the only
creator-bootstrap authority; other admitted members are denied before private
household routing. The roster carries canonical creator-slot availability
independently from both roster size and the requesting account link.
Deterministic domain failures are single-attempt. A pending or outcome-ambiguous
person mutation is the sole admitted roster command: the UI freezes sibling
actions and preserves the exact submitted payload and mutation ID until the
same command obtains a definitive result. The forms validate names before
submission and treat malformed generated-client responses as ambiguous rather
than deterministic domain failures. The public roster query rejects unknown
options. The cumulative runtime proof now covers the full Work Item 01 roster,
restart/restore history, owner/member bootstrap concurrency, and denied
cross-household mutation collisions.

[ADR-0010](../architecture/decisions/0010-coordinate-membership-departure-before-person-archival.md)
now fixes the missing cross-authority departure contract: `MealPlannerApi`
durably creates one deterministic native Cloudflare Workflow before the
authenticated Better Auth removal, the Workflow waits for an outcome signal
and reconciles a missing removal or lost signal by canonical membership read,
and only proven membership absence permits exact-purpose household
finalization. Every partial state remains durable, visible, bounded, and
repairable. Work Item 02 must also configure
`organization({ disableOrganizationDeletion: true })` so neither the public nor
typed Better Auth deletion operation can erase the organization and its
memberships before the separate household deletion lifecycle exists. That
accepted prerequisite promotes Work Item 02 to `Ready`; invitation association,
accepted linking, link repair, departure, and return are still implementation
work. Organization-deletion behavior remains out of scope, and Work Items 03
and 04 remain `Proposed`.

## Completed Foundation

- [PR #198 — person registry and lifecycle](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/198)
  merged on 2026-09-01 as
  `9666a8bdae97bd9d6bf4efd98e30d03d617ccb31`. Work Item 01 is `Done`.
- [PR #189 — household product blueprint](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/189)
  merged on 2026-08-27. Its product decisions, ADRs, and repository-owned
  delivery model are accepted direction.
- Stage 0 is complete. The household-authority foundation and cutover landed
  through [PR #182](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/182),
  [PR #183](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/183),
  [PR #186](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/186),
  [PR #187](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/187),
  [PR #188](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/188),
  [PR #190](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/190),
  [PR #191](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/191), and
  [PR #192](https://github.com/cill-i-am/meal-planner/pull/192).
- One `HouseholdObject` per Better Auth organization is the canonical writer for
  household product state. Better Auth D1 remains the identity, organization,
  membership, invitation, and role control plane. The remaining shared D1 owns
  only global provider accounting.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. After this readiness record merges, assign one delivery owner using Work
   Item 02's exact bounded implementation-agent assignment.
2. Implement invitation association/linking, explicit repair, the accepted
   departure Workflow, and same-person return as one Work Item 02 vertical.
3. Freeze that implementation head for hosted CI, real Better Auth D1 and
   routed-object runtime proof, and fresh independent exact-head review before
   any merge decision.

## Deliberate Non-Work

Do not start Work Items 03 or 04, retailer integration, full pantry inventory,
calories/macros, medical goal systems, MCP delivery, embedded channels, or
generic organization support while Work Item 02 remains the immediate target.
Do not implement organization deletion; keep it disabled until its accepted
household cleanup and tombstone lifecycle is separately authorized and ready.
